I run my PHP scripts with [Cmder](https://github.com/JonasHau/MathForFun/wiki/Softwares-used).

To run scripts with Cmder (or your favourite terminal), place yourself in your PHP directory
`cd usualPHPDirectory`. Then run the script with PHP by pointing at the script you want to run
`php -f Demo/demo.php`.
  
For example, if I'd like to run my CollatzIteration script I'd type :  
```php -f CollatzIteration/collatz.php```
